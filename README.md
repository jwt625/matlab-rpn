# matlab-rpn
Reverse Polish notation calculator within matlab.

## Motivations
- RPN calculator is fast but expensive and lack of abundant functions
- I do calculations and estimations in matlab
- I want physical constants to be quickly available, such as in casio fx-991es-plus but even faster.
- unit conversions, such as Joule to eV
- What's reverse Polish notation: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)

## Reference
- physical constants from https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/
